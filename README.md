# Brainwear-Master-project
Developed a machine learning model to identify walking activity from accelerometer data for gait analysis in brain cancer patients. Utilized a supervised SVM model to differentiate walking from other activities. Experienced in Python, pandas for data analysis, and scikit-learn for machine learning.
